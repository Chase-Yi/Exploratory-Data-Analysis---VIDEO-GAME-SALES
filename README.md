# Exploratory Data Analysis on Video Game Sales
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis on video game sales using R and Python programming languages. The analysis was performed on a dataset that contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies, which was generated by a scrape of [VGChartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/). The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) includes information such as the game's name, platform, year of release, genre, publisher, and sales in various regions.

## RMarkdown File  
The analysis is divided into two parts, which are included in one RMarkdown file:

### EDA - VIDEO GAME SALES using R

The exploratory analysis includes the analysis of the world's best-selling games, number of sales per platform, game sales by genre, number of sales per publisher, and global sales number per year.

### EDA - VIDEO GAME SALES using Python
This part of the RMarkdown file contains exploratory data analysis on video game sales using Python programming language. It covers various analysis related to video game sales, such as top-selling genres, years with the most game releases, top publishers, revenue by region, etc.
